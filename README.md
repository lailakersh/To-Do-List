# AP CSP Project - To-Do-List
#Introduction: A program that allows for the viewing and editing of a "Country Bucket List." This was an AP CSP project. 
#Function: When the program starts up, the user will be asked to pick if they'd like to view, edit, or exit from their ToDO List. If "Option A" is presented, the user's list title and the list itself will be displayed. If "Option B" is selected, then the user will be asked which editing option they would like to proceed with. "Option  C" closes out the program.
